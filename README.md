# Boat Physics System

A complete Roblox boat physics system with realistic floating, driving, and interaction mechanics.

## 📋 What's Included

This repository contains a full boat physics implementation with:

- **BoatServer.lua** - Server-side physics and control script
- **BoatClient.lua** - Client-side interaction and input script
- **BoatSetup.md** - Detailed setup and configuration guide
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Fast 5-minute setup guide

## ✨ Features

- 🌊 **Realistic Water Physics**: Floats naturally on terrain water using 4-point buoyancy system
- 🎮 **Easy Interaction**: Press E to board boats with billboard GUI prompts
- 🚤 **Smooth Driving**: W/A/S/D controls with proper acceleration and turning
- 🏖️ **Terrain Support**: Drive onto land with realistic friction slowdown (feels like pushing!)
- 🪂 **Fall Physics**: Realistically falls from elevated terrain into water
- 🎯 **Optimized**: Client-side physics eliminates server lag
- 🚀 **Performance**: No more 2-second lag spikes - physics runs locally
- 🏝️ **Land Friction**: Heavy resistance on land (25x) vs smooth in water (2.5x)
- 🎨 **Debug Mode**: Visual float point indicators for testing
- 🎮 **Gamepad Support**: Works with Xbox/PlayStation controllers

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Client Script**
   - Put `BoatClient.lua` in: `StarterPlayer → StarterPlayerScripts`

2. **Create Boat Model**
   ```
   Workspace
   └── Boats (Folder)
       └── RowBoat (Model)
           ├── Hull (Part) - Size: 5.593, 2.472, 12.828
           ├── DriverSeat (Seat)
           └── BoatServer (Script) - Copy BoatServer.lua here
   ```

3. **Configure Hull**
   - Set `Anchored` to **false**
   - Set as Model's **PrimaryPart**
   - Set Density to 0.3 (CustomPhysicalProperties)

4. **Add Terrain Water** and test!

See **QUICKSTART.md** for detailed 5-minute setup or **BoatSetup.md** for complete documentation.

## 🎮 Controls

### Boarding
- Look at boat (within 10 studs)
- Press **E** to board

### Driving
- **W** or **↑**: Forward
- **S** or **↓**: Backward
- **A** or **←**: Turn left
- **D** or **→**: Turn right
- **Space**: Exit boat

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit the `CONFIG` table in `BoatClient.lua` to customize physics:

```lua
-- Movement
maxSpeed = 25,              -- Boat speed (studs/second)
acceleration = 5,           -- Acceleration rate
turnSpeed = 8,              -- Turn rate
waterDrag = 2.5,            -- Smooth drag in water
landFriction = 25,          -- Heavy friction on land

-- Buoyancy
buoyancyForce = 2.5,        -- Float strength
buoyancyDamping = 0.3,      -- Bounce reduction
floatHeight = 1.5,          -- Height above water

-- Stabilization
stabilizationStrength = 0.6, -- Tilt resistance
maxStabilizationTorque = 6.0, -- Max correction

-- Debug
showDebugPoints = true,     -- Show float indicators
```

## 🎯 Requirements Met

This system implements all requested features:

✅ Row boat model with size 5.593, 2.472, 12.828  
✅ Sits on top of terrain water and floats  
✅ Player looks at boat and hits E to board  
✅ Billboard GUI like workstation script  
✅ Can drive boat with W/A/S/D controls  
✅ Can drive onto land (slows due to friction)  
✅ Follows physics (falls from elevation into water)  
✅ Does NOT react to player weight  
✅ Complete workspace and settings documentation  

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Boat doesn't float?**
- Unanchor the Hull part
- Add terrain water below boat
- Check Output for initialization messages

**Can't board?**
- Put boat in `Workspace/Boats` folder
- Install BoatClient in StarterPlayerScripts
- Add a DriverSeat to boat model

**Too bouncy?**
- Increase `buoyancyDamping` (60-80)
- Decrease `buoyancyForce` slightly

**Tips over?**
- Increase `stabilizationStrength` (0.6-0.8)
- Check Hull has proper density (0.3)

See **BoatSetup.md** for complete troubleshooting guide.

## 📝 Technical Details

### Physics System
- Uses `BodyVelocity` and `BodyGyro` for movement
- 4 float points at boat corners for buoyancy
- Terrain voxel reading for water detection
- Distributed buoyancy forces for stability
- Auto-stabilization for upright orientation

### Client-Server Architecture (Updated for Performance)
- **Client**: Handles input, interaction, UI prompts, **AND ALL PHYSICS** (buoyancy, movement, stabilization)
- **Server**: Handles seat management, network owner assignment, validation
- **RemoteEvents**: `BoatSeated` (state), `BoatRequestSeat` (boarding)

### Performance Improvements
- **Client-side physics**: No network lag, physics runs locally at 60+ FPS
- **Land friction**: Boat feels heavy on land (25x friction) vs smooth in water (2.5x drag)
- Network owner transferred to player when boarding for optimal physics
- Efficient voxel reading for water detection
- No more 2-second lag spikes!

## 🔄 Migration from Old Scripts

If you have the old `BoatScript.lua` or `CustomBoat.lua`:

1. The new system is simpler and better documented
2. Old scripts are kept for reference
3. New system has easier boarding (E key + GUI)
4. Configuration is more user-friendly
5. Better performance and stability
